That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito, in my opinion, because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice: He does not really agree with the system of "Checks and Balances" built into the Constitution, and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the "Unitary Executive Theory," which calls for vastly-increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court.

In our Constitutional system, we have three branches of the Federal Government: the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches.
In system our Constitutional , have we branches three of the Federal Government : Legislative the , Executive , and Judicial . branches
In our system Constitutional , we three have branches of the Federal Government : the , Legislative , Executive and Judicial branches .

And the basic behind idea the Checks Balances and we have is that if the one branch of Government crazy goes , the other can two hold it down .
But Samuel Alito believes in a little-known Constitutional theory - called the "Unitary Executive Theory" - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch, and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does, including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control, and the Military, which exists, which is regulated, and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress, not to the President.

The Military is not part of the Executive Branch: it is a separate entity.
The military is not part of the Branch Executive : it is separate a entity .
The Military is not part of Executive the : Branch it a is entity separate .
"Commander In Chief" doesn't mean that he is the boss of the Military, merely that he is the Administrator, just as he is the Administrator of the Executive Branch, charged with "executing faithfully" all the laws passed by Congress and all the Decisions rendered by the Supreme Court.

And so Congress the and Supreme become Court mere advisors to the President , with authority no real over him .
And the President becomes a Dictator, unrestrained by anything in the Constitution, backed up by the Armed Forces, which would be entirely under his personal control.

I have never considered this a real problem as I travel without kids and can fend for myself, but when I had to listen to a (non-violent) domestic fight that lasted from 1 AM to 5 AM during my last stay and I found out that the front desk was unmanned during night hours, my choice was to either waste tax payers money by calling for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel, or just get over it.
